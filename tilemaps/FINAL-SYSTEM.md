# Updated Tilemap System - Red Pixels as Coordinate Markers

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Red Pixel Purpose Clarified
- **Red pixels** `#ff0000` are now **coordinate markers** that define where (0,0) is centered on the map
- They are NOT special floor tiles around (0,0) - they MARK the center point
- Red pixels get converted to space tiles during processing

### 2. Automatic Origin Calculation
- The system now automatically calculates the map origin based on red pixel positions
- When you place red pixels in your PNG, the system finds their center and sets that as the (0,0) coordinate
- This means you can place red pixels anywhere in your image to mark where the center should be

### 3. Wall Tiles Already Black
- Wall tiles already render as black (`#000000`) in the game
- No changes needed for this requirement

## How It Works Now

1. **Create PNG with red pixels** marking where you want (0,0) to be
2. **System automatically detects** red pixels and calculates their center
3. **Origin is set** so that red pixel center maps to coordinate (0,0)
4. **Red pixels become space tiles** (walkable)
5. **Map renders correctly** with proper coordinate alignment

## Example
If you place red pixels at positions (10, 10), (10, 11), (11, 10), (11, 11) in your PNG:
- System calculates center: (10.5, 10.5)
- Origin becomes: (-672, -672) [because (10.5 * 64) = 672]
- This means the red pixel area will be centered at coordinate (0,0) in the game

## Benefits
- **Flexible positioning**: Red pixels can be anywhere in your image
- **Automatic centering**: No need to manually calculate origins
- **Real-time updates**: PNG changes automatically update the map
- **Coordinate accuracy**: (0,0) is exactly where you mark it with red pixels

The system is now running and ready to test with your PNG files!
